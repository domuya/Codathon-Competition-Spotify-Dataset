Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Python Codathon project, where my team and I used data science techniques to predict the next hit songs in the Spotify dataset.

This project was a part of a Codathon competition hosted by Hult International Business School, where we were tasked with using machine learning algorithms to analyze Spotify's vast library of music data to identify potential hit songs. Our team used various data science techniques to preprocess the dataset, train and test multiple machine learning models, and evaluate their performance to select the most accurate model for the prediction.

In this repository, you will find all the code and resources used in our project, along with detailed documentation and instructions to help you understand our approach. Our goal is to make this repository as accessible and user-friendly as possible, so that other data science enthusiasts and researchers can replicate our methods, build upon our work, and contribute to the field of music data analysis.

I hope that you find this project informative and useful, and I welcome any feedback or contributions that you may have. Thank you for taking the time to explore our repository, and I hope that our work inspires you to embark on your own exciting data science projects!
